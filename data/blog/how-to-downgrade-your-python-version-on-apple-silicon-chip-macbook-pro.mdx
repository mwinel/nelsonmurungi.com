title: 'How to downgrade your Python Version on Apple Silicon Chip MacBook Pro'
publishedAt: '2022-11-18'
summary: 'When you install XCode on your MacBook Pro, by default it will install the latest version of Python. This guide takes you through the process of downgrading to a lower python version. The same steps can be used if you want to work with another version of Python.'
---

First: You will need to install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) with homebrew on your MacBook Pro. Pyenv lets you easily switch between multiple versions of [Python](https://www.python.org).

```
brew update
brew install pyenv
```

OR: Clone the repository to get the latest version of pyenv.

```
git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv
```

Next: You will have to define your enviroment variables to set path changes.

```
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

After setting your enviroment variables, restart your shell so the path changes take effect.

```
exec "$SHELL"
```

Verify the pyenv installation and check the available python versions. This will show you a list of different python versions available for installation.

```
pyenv install --list
```

Install your desired python version.

```
pyenv install 3.8
```

Set your desired python version as your global version after installation.

```
pyenv global 3.8
```

Lastly: Verify your current python version your system is currently running.

```
python3 --version
```

You should see search a response in your terminal highlighting the python version your system is currently running on.

```
Python 3.8.0
```
